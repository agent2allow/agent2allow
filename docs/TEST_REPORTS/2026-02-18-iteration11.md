# Test Report: Iteration 11 (2026-02-18)

## Scope under test
- Release/security gap closure docs and workflow.
- Doctor command JSON/strict modes.
- UI operator UX refinements (custom reasons + audit filters).

## Commands
```bash
cd gateway && ruff check src tests
cd gateway && pytest -q
cd ui && npm run lint
cd ui && npm test --silent
./scripts/dev_check.sh
./agent2allow doctor
./agent2allow doctor --json
./agent2allow doctor --strict
```

## Results
- Gateway lint/tests: pass (`real-mode` tests remain env-gated and skipped by default).
- UI lint/tests: pass with new controls/filters rendered.
- `doctor`:
  - default mode: pass with warnings when services are not running.
  - `--json`: emits machine-readable diagnostics payload.
  - `--strict`: exits non-zero when warnings are present.
