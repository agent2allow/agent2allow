# Test Report: Iteration 9 (2026-02-18)

## Scope under test
- Gateway readiness endpoint and compose healthchecks.
- Optional real-mode safety integration tests (env-gated).

## Commands
```bash
cd gateway && ruff check src tests
cd gateway && pytest -q
cd ui && npm run lint
cd ui && npm test --silent
./scripts/dev_check.sh
```

## Results
- Gateway lint/tests: pass, including readiness checks and real-mode test skip behavior.
- UI lint/tests: pass.
- `dev_check.sh`: pass (compose validation skipped in WSL if Docker unavailable there).
- Real-mode safety tests are skipped unless `REAL_GITHUB_ENABLE_TESTS=true` and token/repo are set.
