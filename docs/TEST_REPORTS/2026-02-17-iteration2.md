# Test Report: Iteration 2 (2026-02-17)

## Scope under test
- GitHub connector retry/backoff behavior for transient failures.
- Operator troubleshooting guidance for denied tool calls.

## Commands
```bash
cd gateway && ruff check src tests
cd gateway && pytest -q
```

## Results
- `ruff check`: pass
- `pytest -q`: pass
  - verified retries on HTTP 500/429 with eventual success
  - verified final failure when retries exhausted on connection error
- Docker smoke: not executed in local WSL session because `docker` is unavailable in this environment.
  - expected verification path: CI `demo-smoke` and `compose-smoke` jobs

## Notes
- Retries apply only to transient statuses (`429, 500, 502, 503, 504`) and timeout/connect failures.
- Backoff is bounded by configured attempts and milliseconds per attempt.
