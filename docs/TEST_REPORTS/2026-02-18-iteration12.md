# Test Report: Iteration 12 (2026-02-18)

## Scope under test
- Optional SDK OpenAPI export and typed generation scripts.
- Lightweight RBAC enforcement on approval endpoints.
- External audit sink adapter wiring.
- Policy diff/check command and CLI wrapper.

## Commands
```bash
cd gateway && ruff check src tests
cd gateway && pytest -q
python3 scripts/export_openapi.py
node sdk/js/scripts/generate_openapi_types.mjs
python3 sdk/python/scripts/generate_openapi_types.py
./agent2allow policy-diff gateway/config/default-policy.yml gateway/config/default-policy.yml --strict
```

## Results
- Gateway lint/tests: pass.
- OpenAPI export + JS/Python type generation: pass.
- Policy diff strict mode on identical files: pass (exit 0, no effective changes).
- RBAC integration checks:
  - unmapped approver blocked (`403`) when RBAC enabled.
  - high-risk approval requires admin role when configured.
