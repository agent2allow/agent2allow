# [DX][REL] Bulk approval API endpoint + roadmap refresh

## Problem
- Bulk UI approvals still required one HTTP request per selected item.
- Roadmap did not reflect newly shipped reliability/security milestones.

## Solution
- Added `POST /v1/approvals/bulk` with per-ID result payload.
- Updated UI bulk approve/deny to use the single bulk endpoint.
- Added integration test for multi-item bulk approval execution.
- Refreshed roadmap into completed vs next priorities.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
```

## Breaking changes
- None. Existing single-item endpoints remain unchanged.
