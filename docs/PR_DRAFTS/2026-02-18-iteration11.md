# [REL][SEC][DX] Final gap closure: release docs, security runbook, doctor upgrades, real-mode workflow

## Problem
- Remaining readiness gaps: release hygiene docs, security runbook docs, manual real-mode test workflow, and richer diagnostics/operator UX.

## Solution
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/releasing.md`.
- Added `docs/security/threat-model.md` and `docs/security/incident-response.md` and linked from `SECURITY.md`.
- Added manual workflow `.github/workflows/real-mode-safety.yml` (workflow_dispatch + repo input + secret token).
- Upgraded `./agent2allow doctor` with `--json` and `--strict`.
- Improved UI with custom approval/deny reasons and additional audit filters (`idempotent_replay`, `schema version`).
- Updated roadmap and quickstart references.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
./agent2allow doctor --json
```

## Breaking changes
- None.
