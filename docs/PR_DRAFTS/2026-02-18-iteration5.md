# [DX][REL] Bulk approval UX + audit schema versioning

## Problem
- Operators had to approve/deny one item at a time.
- Audit payloads had no explicit schema version marker, making future parser evolution risky.

## Solution
- Added bulk controls in UI (`Approve selected`, `Deny selected`) with multi-select support.
- Added clearer status chips in audit table.
- Added `schema_version` field to audit records and API/export payloads.
- Added SQLite startup migration to backfill missing `schema_version` column on existing DBs.
- Added integration assertions for schema version visibility.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
```

## Breaking changes
- None. `schema_version` is additive.
