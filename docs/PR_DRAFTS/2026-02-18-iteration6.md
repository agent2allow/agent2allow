# [DX][SEC] Connector authoring guide + runtime contract checks

## Problem
- Connector extension guidance was too brief for consistent contributions.
- Service could be initialized with incompatible connector objects.

## Solution
- Expanded connector concept docs with clear design, policy, and test requirements.
- Added `connectors/template/README.md` as a copy-paste implementation checklist.
- Added runtime-checkable `GithubConnectorContract`.
- Added service guard to reject non-compliant connectors at startup.
- Added connector contract tests.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
```

## Breaking changes
- None for existing compliant connectors.
