# [DX][REL] UI status banner + `agent2allow doctor` diagnostics

## Problem
- UI lacked immediate visibility into service readiness.
- Troubleshooting local setup required multiple manual checks.

## Solution
- Added a system status banner in UI showing health/readiness and check breakdown.
- Added `./agent2allow doctor` command that runs local diagnostics (docker/compose, policy validation, endpoint reachability).
- Updated quickstart and deployment docs with doctor usage.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
./agent2allow doctor
```

## Breaking changes
- None.
