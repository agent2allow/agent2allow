# [SEC][DX] Typed SDK OpenAPI flow + approval RBAC + external audit sink + policy diff

## Problem
- Next roadmap priorities were still open: typed SDK generation, approval RBAC, external audit sink adapter, and policy change diff tooling.

## Solution
- Added OpenAPI export script and SDK type generators:
  - `scripts/export_openapi.py`
  - `sdk/js/scripts/generate_openapi_types.mjs`
  - `sdk/python/scripts/generate_openapi_types.py`
- Added generated SDK typing artifacts and updated SDK clients/docs.
- Added optional approval RBAC controls on approve/deny/bulk approval endpoints.
- Added external audit sink adapter framework (`none`, `syslog`, `s3`, `blob`).
- Added policy diff/check command: `gateway/scripts/policy_diff.py`, exposed via `./agent2allow policy-diff`.
- Updated quickstart/concepts/changelog/roadmap docs.

## How to test
```bash
cd gateway && pytest -q
python3 scripts/export_openapi.py
./agent2allow policy-diff gateway/config/default-policy.yml gateway/config/default-policy.yml --strict
```

## Breaking changes
- None (all new behavior is opt-in or additive).
