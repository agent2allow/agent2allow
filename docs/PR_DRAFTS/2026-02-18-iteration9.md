# [REL][SEC] Add readiness probes and real-mode safety test harness

## Problem
- Deployment checks only validated liveness, not startup readiness.
- Real GitHub mode lacked an explicit, non-destructive safety test path.

## Solution
- Added `GET /ready` endpoint to validate service initialization, DB connectivity, and policy file presence.
- Added compose healthchecks for gateway, mock-github, and UI.
- Updated smoke script to wait for readiness instead of liveness.
- Added optional env-gated real-mode safety tests (`tests/test_real_mode_safety.py`).
- Updated deployment and quickstart docs.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
```

## Breaking changes
- None.
