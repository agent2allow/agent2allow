# [DX][SEC] Approval reason presets + policy wizard scaffold

## Problem
- Approvals required repetitive free-form reasons.
- New users lacked a fast path to generate safe starter policies.

## Solution
- Added approval/deny reason presets in UI, reusable for single and bulk actions.
- Added `gateway/scripts/policy_wizard.py` to generate deny-by-default policy templates.
- Added tests for wizard output variants.
- Documented wizard usage in quickstart and policy concepts.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
```

## Breaking changes
- None.
