# [DX][SEC] Add local dev check script and policy validation guardrail

## Problem
- Local quality checks required multiple manual commands and were easy to run inconsistently.
- Policy mistakes were only detected indirectly at runtime.

## Solution
- Added `scripts/dev_check.sh` to run policy validation, gateway checks, UI checks, and compose validation.
- Added `gateway/scripts/validate_policy.py` for strict policy schema/risk checks.
- Added validator tests.
- Added validator step into CI lint workflow.
- Documented validator and local check usage in quickstart/policies docs.

## How to test
```bash
./scripts/dev_check.sh
```

## Breaking changes
- None.
