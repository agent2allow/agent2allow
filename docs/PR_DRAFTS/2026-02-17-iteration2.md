# [REL] Retry/backoff for GitHub connector + denied-call troubleshooting docs

## Problem
- Transient GitHub API failures (rate limits, temporary upstream errors) caused avoidable demo and runtime failures.
- Users lacked a concrete runbook for diagnosing denied tool calls.

## Solution
- Added retry/backoff in the GitHub connector for transient HTTP statuses and network timeouts.
- Exposed retry configuration in gateway settings.
- Added connector tests covering retry success and retry exhaustion behavior.
- Extended quickstart/policy docs with denied-call troubleshooting steps.

## How to test
```bash
cd gateway && ruff check src tests
cd gateway && pytest -q
```

Manual docs check:
- open `docs/quickstart.md` and verify the denied-call checklist
- open `docs/concepts/policies.md` and verify policy mismatch guidance

## Impact
- Improved reliability under transient API instability.
- Faster operator resolution of policy denials without code changes.

## Breaking changes
- None.
