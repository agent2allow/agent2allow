# [DX][MOAT] Improve quickstart confidence and triage/audit usability

## Problem
First-run success needed stronger deterministic validation, and the operator audit view was too minimal for fast incident triage.

## Solution
- Added deterministic mock demo smoke script and integrated it into CI.
- Upgraded README/quickstart with concrete demo expectations.
- Added configurable triage template and better demo summary output.
- Improved UI audit viewer with filters, event details expansion, and JSONL export.
- Added iteration artifacts (repo map, competitive notes, north star, test report).

## How to test
1. `cd gateway && ruff check src tests && pytest -q`
2. `cd ui && npm run lint && npm test --silent && npm run build`
3. `npm run demo` (with gateway + mock github running)
4. `./scripts/smoke_mock_demo.sh` (CI/local docker environments)

## Risk
- CI duration increases due demo-smoke job.
- Mitigated by limiting smoke stack to `gateway` + `mock-github` services.
